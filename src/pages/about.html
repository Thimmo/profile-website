        Hi there! My name is Saheed, a product designer with over 2 years experience. I have worked on several projects and I am proficient with tools like figma and framer. I am currently on a six-month training with seamfix NextGen where I am being taught fundamentals of frontend development, allowing me to create projects such as the one that enables you to read this.
